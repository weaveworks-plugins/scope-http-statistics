# Scope HTTP Statistics Plugin

The Scope HTTP Statistics plugin provide to the [Weave Scope](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope) user statistics about HTTP traffic at the process level using eBPF, as of now only the number of HTTP requests are collected.
The UI will show the number of requests as a single value and graph which are updated every second.
The HTTP Statistics plugin does not use any application-level instrumentation, it has a negligible performance toll (metrics are obtained in-kernel without any packet copying to user space).

**Note:** This plugin needs a [recent kernel version with eBPF support](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#kernel-configuration).
It will not compile on current [dlite](https://github.com/nlf/dlite) and boot2docker hosts.
You need `/sys/kernel/debug/` in order to be able to build the eBPF program generated by the plugin.

## How to Run Scope HTTP Statistics Plugin

* Run the HTTP Statistics plugin
	* `git clone git@github.com:weaveworks-plugins/scope-http-requests.git`
	* `cd scope-http-requests; make`

**Note** If Scope HTTP Statistics plugin has been registered by Scope, you will see it in the list of `PLUGINS` in the bottom right of the UI (see the rectangle in the above figure).

* In another terminal, run an `nginx` instance `docker run --rm --name http-requests-nginx -p 8080:80 nginx`
* Run `sh test-http-requests.sh`, press Ctrl+c to terminate the test.
* Go to the Weave Scope UI [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040).
* Open the `http-requests-nginx` container.
* Click on `nginx: worker process` in the "Processes" table.

## Plugin internals

Below you see the `Plugins` section of the [reporter interface](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/tree/master/examples/plugins#reporter-interface).

```json
{
  "Plugins": [
    {
      "id":          "http-statistics",
      "label":       "HTTP Statistics",
      "description": "Adds http request metrics to processes",
      "interfaces":  ["reporter"],
      "api_version": "1",
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

The HTTP Statistics plugin also has a `Processes` section, where the per process metrics are stored, an example of which you'll find below.

```json
{
  ...
  "Process": {
    "metric_templates": {
      "http_requests_per_second": {
        "id": "http_requests_per_second",
        "label": "HTTP Req/Second",
        "priority": 0.1
      }
    },
    "nodes": {
      "example.org;29770": {
        "metrics": {
          "http_requests_per_second": {
            "samples": [
              {
                "date": "2016-09-21T07:22:24.293175Z",
                "value": 1.0
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`Processes` has a single `metric_template` array field containing one or more elements.
These elements describe the various types of metrics contained by each element of the `nodes` field.
Each element in the `nodes` section identifies a process on a specific host.
The element identifier is generated by concatenating the hostname and the PID with `;` as delimiter (e.g. `example.org;29770`).
Each element contains the metrics data provided by the HTTP Statistics plugin (just one metric in the example).
The data may contain many samples (just one in the example).
